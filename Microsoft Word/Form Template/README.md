# General Idea

Have a User Interface page for the user to select pre-filled fields

<br>
Once the fields are filled and the submit button is clicked, the template is generated with the relevant fields filled.

Where there are checkboxes, these can be ticked to select the option required. Options not ticked will be deleted.
For example:
From this:

To:
