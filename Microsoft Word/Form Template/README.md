<br>
Once the fields are filled and the submit button is clicked,

<br>
The template is generated with the relevant fields filled.

Where there are checkboxes, these can be ticked to select the option required. Options not ticked will be deleted.
For example:
<br>

<br>
![alt text](image-3.png)
<br>
To:
<br>
![alt text](image-4.png)
