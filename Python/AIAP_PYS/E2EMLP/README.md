A `README.md` file that sufficiently explains the pipeline design and its usage. You are
required to explain the thought process behind your pipeline in the README. The
README is expected to contain the following:
a. Full name (as in NRIC) and email address (stated in your application form).
b. Overview of the submitted folder and the folder structure.
c. Instructions for executing the pipeline and modifying any parameters.
d. Description of logical steps/flow of the pipeline. If you find it useful, please feel
free to include suitable visualization aids (eg, flow charts) within the README.
e. Overview of key findings from the EDA conducted in Task 1 and the choices made
in the pipeline based on these findings, particularly any feature engineering.
Please keep the details of the EDA in the `.ipynb`. The information in the
`README.md` should be a quick summary of the details from `.ipynb`.
f. Describe how the features in the dataset are processed (summarized in a table).
g. Explanation of your choice of models.
h. Evaluation of the models developed. Any metrics used in the evaluation should
also be explained.
